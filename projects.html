        <h2>Project 1: Introduction to Networking I Final Project</h2>
        <p>
        In this project, me and my friend/groupmate were tasked
        to modify a network topology to work to the point where we had to configure the VLANs,
        Routers, Switches, PCs and etc to make sure everything was active and working in order to successfully deliver this project.

        <h2>Project 2: Introduction to Programming Group Project</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, me and my two other friends grouped up to work
            on this assignment. The purpose of this assignment was to make a game 
            out of the few options our prof had given us. We worked together as a team
            as a team and made it happen as the game was successful and working.

        <h2>Project 3: CCNA: Introduction to Networking I</h2>
        <p>
            In order to obtain the CCNA certificate, we had to get an 80% plus on a exam on CCNA and I successfully obtained it. This certification
            shows that I am certified with CCNA knowledge and capable of doing CCNA. This will also help me for when I am looking for an internship/job
            opportunity since it shows I have CCNA background knowledge.

            ,relating to stats. I completed almost all questions on this assignment, demonstrating my full knowledge within the course material and hope to get a
